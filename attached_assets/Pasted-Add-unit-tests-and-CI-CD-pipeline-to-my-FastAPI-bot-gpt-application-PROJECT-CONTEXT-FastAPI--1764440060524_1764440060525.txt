Add unit tests and CI/CD pipeline to my FastAPI bot-gpt application.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- FastAPI application with main.py
- Endpoints: /health, POST /conversations, GET /conversations, GET /conversations/{id}, POST /conversations/{id}/messages, DELETE /conversations/{id}
- Using pytest for testing
- Need GitHub Actions for CI/CD

TASK 1: CREATE UNIT TESTS

Create a tests folder with the following structure:
tests/
├── __init__.py (empty file)
└── test_api.py (with test functions)

In test_api.py, write these test functions:
1. test_health_endpoint()
   - Test GET /health
   - Assert status code is 200
   - Assert response contains {"status": "healthy"}

2. test_create_conversation()
   - Test POST /conversations
   - Send: {"user_id": 1, "message": "Test message", "mode": "open"}
   - Assert status code is 200
   - Assert response has "conversation_id" field
   - Assert response has "response" field

3. test_list_conversations()
   - Test GET /conversations?user_id=1
   - Assert status code is 200
   - Assert response has "conversations" field

4. test_get_conversation() (bonus)
   - First create a conversation
   - Then GET /conversations/{id}
   - Assert status code is 200
   - Assert response has "messages" field

5. test_delete_conversation() (bonus)
   - First create a conversation
   - Then DELETE /conversations/{id}
   - Assert status code is 200

Use FastAPI's TestClient:
- Import: from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
- Import: from main import app
- Create client: client = TestClient(app)
- Use client.get(), client.post(), client.delete() for testing

Add proper docstrings to each test function explaining what it tests.

TASK 2: UPDATE requirements.txt

Add these testing dependencies to requirements.txt:
pytest==7.4.0
pytest-cov==4.1.0
httpx==0.24.1

TASK 3: CREATE CI/CD PIPELINE

Create .github/workflows/ci.yml with this configuration:

Name: CI Pipeline
Trigger: On push and pull_request to main/master branches
Job: test
Runs on: ubuntu-latest

Steps:
1. Checkout code (uses: actions/checkout@v3)
2. Set up Python 3.11 (uses: actions/setup-python@v4)
3. Install dependencies:
   - Upgrade pip
   - Install from requirements.txt
4. Run tests with pytest:
   - Command: pytest -v
   - Pass GROQ_API_KEY from GitHub secrets

Add comments in the YAML file explaining each step.

TASK 4: UPDATE README.md

Add a new section called "🧪 Testing" after the "Running the Application" section with:

Subsections:
1. "Run Tests Locally"
   - How to install pytest
   - Command to run tests: pytest -v
   - Command to run with coverage: pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

2. "Continuous Integration"
   - Explain that GitHub Actions runs tests automatically
   - How to view test results in Actions tab
   - How to add GROQ_API_KEY as GitHub secret

3. "Test Structure"
   - Explain what each test does
   - Show test file structure

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use proper Python type hints
- Add docstrings to all test functions
- Use assert statements for test validation
- Keep tests simple and readable
- Add comments explaining key test logic
- Make sure tests can run without actual GROQ API calls initially (use mocks if needed for bonus points, but basic version can use real API)
- CI/CD file should be valid YAML with proper indentation
- All code should follow the same style as existing code

BONUS (Optional):
- Add a test for invalid conversation_id (should return 404)
- Add a test for missing required fields (should return 422)
- Mock GROQ API responses to avoid using real API quota in tests
- Add code coverage reporting to CI/CD
- Add a CI badge to README.md

Make it interview-quality: clean, well-documented, and easy to understand.
